#+title: Shoeprint Image Retrieval

* Datasets

The download link for the processed WVU2019 dataset and the shell script for processing the Impress dataset can be found in the =Datasets= directory.

* Code

The tests can be run as such:

#+begin_src python
from main import *

rankings = orchestrate("../Datasets/Impress/", 60, "impress", rotations=[-15, -9, -3, 3, 9, 15, 180], search_scales=[1.02, 1.04, 1.08], device="cpu")
cmp_all(rankings, total_references=300, total_prints=2292)
#+end_src

The orchestrate function can load datasets as ~impress~, ~WVU2019~ or ~FID-300~.
The specified directory should contain =Query= and =Gallery= directories.
